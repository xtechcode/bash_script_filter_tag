# bash_script_filter_tag

Because a friend/colleague from my work asked me if it was possible to make a script (instead to do it manually) ...
And because I am 21st Century Schizoid Man  ;) 

This bash_script is to filter (xml)files by the presence of tag (DeviceType) filled with unic value as :

<DeviceType>SAT</DeviceType>
<DeviceType>TV</DeviceType>
<DeviceType>AMP</DeviceType>
<DeviceType>TUNER</DeviceType>
<DeviceType>DVD</DeviceType>

and put result(s)/files in a new directory named rxg_filter_results.

Nb: I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a> after I made the script.
